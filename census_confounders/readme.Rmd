THE INTERPOLATED CENSUS CONFOUNDER DATA IS IN census_interpolated_zips.csv
THE UNINTERPOLATED CENSUS CONFOUNDER DATA IS IN census_interpolated_zips.csv

This directory contains a dataset with demographic information from the US census and American Community Survey at the zipcode level.
The data was downloaded from the census social explorer website by Fei Carnes.

The file make.R can be executed to recreate the processing steps that created cenesus_interpolated_zips.csv

In brief, the steps are as follows:

1st: The variables which are spread out across multiple files are combined in to a single file. The layout files and the varibles within 
them are indicated in census_list.yml. read_census_data.R is the code which creates the initial dataset. As the source is census dataset
data points are located at zctas rather than zipcodes. Years without assosciated files are included as missing data.

2nd: Temporal interpolation is performed. interpolate_census.R performs this operation using functions from interpolate_function.R. 
A moving average is calculated within each zcta and used to fill in the missing years. See the ImputeTS for more details on the 
algorithm. Any rows that still have missing data (implying no data was available for the particular zcta) are discarded 
(around 200 zipcodes were discarded).

3rd: A crosswalk file is used to link the zctas in the dataset to zipcodes. This is done by zip_zcta_crosswalk.R

Data was available for the year 2000, and from 2011-2016. All other years were interpolated

Variables:

poverty: % of the population older than 65 below the poverty line
popdensity: population density per square mile
medianhousevalue: median value of owner occupied properties
pct_blk: % of the population listed as black
medhouseholdincome: median household income
pct_owner_occ: % of housing units occupied by their owner
hispanic: % of the population identified as hispanic, regardless of reported race
education: % of the population older than 65 not graduating from high school
population: total population
pct_asian:  % of the population listed as asian
pct_native:  % of the population listed as native american
pct_white:  % of the population listed as white

Equivalent variables to some of these are available in the business analyst datasets on the RCE. The choice was made
to use census and acs variables as they were available over a larger time frame than the business analyst dataset in addition 
to haveing greater temporal coverage.

Within this dataset there are ~38,000 unique zipcodes. There are around 47,000 unqiue zipcodes in the unmerged medicare mortality
dataset. This difference has been attributed to out of date and incorrect zipcodes entered in to the medicare dataset as the standard
list of zipcodes nationally provided by ESRI only contains ~41,000 zipcodes. When merging with the confounder data, ~0.2% of the medicare
data will be lost. This accounts to a loss of a similar proportion of individuals within the data.
