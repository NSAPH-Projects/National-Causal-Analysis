This directory contains information about duplicate QID/year
combinations in the health denominator data, i.e.,
ci3_health_data/medicare/mortality/2000_2012/unmerged_data/denominator_1999_2013.csv`.

`duplicate_qid_example.txt` contains some examples discovered early
on. `qid_dup_summary.csv` contains counts of duplicates by year.
`qid_dup_data.csv` contains the actual duplicate records.


A typical example is reproduced below (wrapped for readability):

sex	race	age	hmoind	hmo_mo	year	bene_dod	
2	1	80	0	0	2000			
2	1	80	0	0	2000			
2	1	80	0	0	2000	20MAY2000	
2	1	80	0	0	2000	20MAY2000	
                                                                                                                         
qid             statecode	fips	latitude	longitude

lllllll000l78OS	HI	        15003	21.296254	-157.696767

dodflag	dual	zipcode_r	zip
	0	22869		96822
	1	22869		96822
	0	52869		96825
	1	52869		96825

In this example, "bene_dod", "latitude", "longitude" and "dual" vary
within year=2000 + qid=lllllll000l78OS identifier, and we don't have a
clear basis for deciding which is the "right" one. Yun suggested that
this should be left up to the analyst using the data, and that since
the proportions are small (see `qid_dup_summary.csv`) selection one
of the duplicates at random should be an OK strategy.
